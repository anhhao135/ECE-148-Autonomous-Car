## Dependencies

### [cv2](https://opencv.org/)

Description TBD

### [adafruit_servokit](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/servokit/en/latest/)


### [cv_bridge](http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge)

Description TBD

### [simple-pid](https://pypi.org/project/simple-pid/)

## Structure

### Nodes

#### **throttle_client**

Associated file: throttle_client.py

This node subscribes to the [throttle](#Topics) topic. We use subscriber callback function
to validate and normalize throttle value, and then use the [adafruit_servokit](#adafruit_servokit)
module on **channel 0** for sending signals to the hardware.

This node is also responsible for reading and setting the throttle calibration values.

#### **steering_client**

Associated file: steering_client.py

Similar to [throttle_client](#throttle_client), this node subscribes to the [steering](#Topics)
topic and pass the signals to the hardware. The steering servo is on **channel 1**.

#### **camera_server**

Associated file: camera_server.py

This node simply reads from the camera with cv2's interface and publish the image to the
[camera_rgb](#Topics) topic.

#### **lane_detection_node**

Associated file: lane_detection.py

In this node, we read from [camera_rgb](#Topics) topic and use opencv to identify line
information from the image, and publish the information of the middle point between
all identified lines to the [centroid](#Topics) topic.

#### **lane_guidance_node**

Associated file: lane_guidance.py

This node subscribes to the [centroid](#Topics) topic, calculates the throttle and steering
based on the centroid value, and then publish them to their corresponding topics.

Throttle is based on whether or not a centroid exists - car goes faster when centroid is present and slows down when there is none.

Steering is based on a PID controller implemented by the [simple-pid](#simple-pid) module. Gains can be tweaked in the **lane_guidance.py** script.

| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| throttle   | std_msgs.msg.Float32  | Float value from -1 to 1 for controlling throttle          |
| steering   | std_msgs.msg.Float32  | Float value from -1 to 1 for controlling steering          |
| camera_rgb | sensor_msgs.msg.Image | Image last read from USB camera image                      |
| centroid   | std_msgs.msg.Int32    | Integer for x coordinate of centroid in camera image space |

## Issues and Fixes

### **cv_bridge conversion from Image message to OpenCV image**

Using **bridge_object.imgmsg_to_cv2()** threw errors on our Jetson Nano environment, so we had to resort to our own image decoder function. Function **decodeImage()** can be imported from **decoder.py**.
